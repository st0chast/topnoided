Topnoided is a small project with a clear purpose: to welcome and empower noided contributors and users. This liberating mission shapes the project. 

Interactions with or within this project shall not mention the term *code of conduct*. Use the term *guidelines* instead. The name of this file is a GitHub technicality.

Absolute transparency is paramount in providing a safe space for noided people. All reports of misconduct must be public and judged by quality, not quantity.

Contributors are innocent until proven guilty by the maintainer.

These guidelines take effect only within this repository. This project does not have any official representation anywhere else.
